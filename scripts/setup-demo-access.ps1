.SYNOPSIS
  Automates the access side of demoing a resource the user built themselves (a Foundry
  deployment, an ADF pipeline, or any other Azure resource) — the mechanical half of
  ../.github/skills/demo-production/references/external-resource-access.md. That file
  decides WHICH role and WHOSE credential; this script performs the actual Azure calls
  once that decision is made, so nothing has to be typed by hand from a doc.

.DESCRIPTION
  Three independent modes, matching the decision procedure's steps 3 and 4:

    -Verify     Read-only. Confirms the current `az` session can see the target resource
                and reports which account/subscription it resolved against. Use this for
                the interactive-credential path — no role, no mutation, nothing to confirm.

    -Plan       Read-only. Prints the EXACT service-principal plan (name, role, scope) that
                -CreateSpn would execute, without creating anything. Show this to the user
                and get their explicit go-ahead before re-running with -CreateSpn — the two
                switches share the same parameters, so what's shown is what gets created.

    -CreateSpn  Mutating. Creates the service principal, assigns the one role at the one
                resource scope given, and writes the credential to a git-ignored local file
                — never to the console, never into any file this repo tracks. Only ever run
                this after a human has approved the -Plan output for the same parameters.

  Least-privilege role selection is NOT this script's job — decide the role using the
  azure-rbac skill (if available) or the fallback table in external-resource-access.md,
  then pass it in with -Role. This script will not guess a role for you.

.EXAMPLE
  # Step 3 (interactive path) — just confirm the current session can see it.
  ./scripts/setup-demo-access.ps1 -Verify -ResourceId /subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/rg-foundry/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/my-foundry

.EXAMPLE
  # Step 4a/4b — show the plan, change nothing.
  ./scripts/setup-demo-access.ps1 -Plan -ResourceId /subscriptions/.../my-foundry -Role "Cognitive Services User"

.EXAMPLE
  # Step 4c — after the user has explicitly approved the plan above.
  ./scripts/setup-demo-access.ps1 -CreateSpn -ResourceId /subscriptions/.../my-foundry -Role "Cognitive Services User"
